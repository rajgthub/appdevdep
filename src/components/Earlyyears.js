      All activities that the pre-school provides support the seven areas of learning and
      development which form the essential basis for later stage studies in school and beyond.
      </p>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2">
      To track children’s learning and development, the allocated keyperson produces and
      maintains a variety of evidence such as observations, Learning Journeys, pictorial
      evidence and termly summary reports. These evidence records are kept confidential of
      all children by their key person to help their further development and kept between
      parent/carer and staff.
      </p>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2">
      When they move onto their next setting (nursery or reception class), the keyperson and
      parents together fill out a ‘Transition document’ to send it to the new setting as an
      evidence of the children’s learning and development and to ensure continuity of
      education.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2">The Prime areas are fundamental, work together and move through to support development in all other areas, they are:</p>
         <ul className=" list grey-text text-darken-2">
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Personal, social and emotional development.</li>
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Communication and language.</li>
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Physical development.</li>
          </ul>   
         <br/>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2">The specific areas include essential skills and knowledge for children to participate successfully in society, they are:</p>
          <ul className="list grey-text text-darken-2">
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Literacy</li>
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Mathematics.</li>
            <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Understanding of the World.</li>
            <li><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Expressive Arts and Design</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2">The principles which guide the work of all early years practioners are grouped into four themes:</p>
          <ul className="list grey-text text-darken-2">
             <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>A unique child.</li>
             <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Positive relationships.</li>
             <li className="list"><i className=" tiny material-icons">child_care</i>Learning and development.</li>
           </ul>
           <br/>
           <h5 className="grey-text grey-bold-2 text-darken-2">2yr old progress checks</h5>
      <p className="grey-text text-darken-2"> 
      The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) requires that parents and carers must be
      supplied with a short written summery of their child’s development in the three prime
      learning and development areas of the EYFS: Personal, Social and Emotional
      Development, Physical Development and Communication and Language, when the child
      is aged between 24. In accordance with the Local Authority, we carry out and record a
      two years old progress check on the three prime areas with the support of the
      parents/carers. This is photo copied with one copy for your child’s progress file, one
      copy for your red book.
      Parents are expected to book an appointment with their Health Visitor for ASQ
      developmental check to be done when the child age is under 3. Parents provides the
      outcome of this assessment to the allocated keyperson when the child starts the setting
      to enable the child’s development to thrive.
